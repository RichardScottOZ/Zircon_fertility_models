Desicion trees to predict fertile zircon from porphyry copper deposits

This is the repository for the code of the zircon fertility app associated witht the study: `Quantifying the criteria used to identify zircons from ore-bearing and barren systems in porphyry copper exploration`, currently under review. 
The app is available at: [https://ccarr.shinyapps.io/Zircon_fertility_models/](https://ccarr.shinyapps.io/Zircon_fertility_models/)
